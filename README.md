# Plain

Plain language is a toy language I dreamed up while building my first compiler. I've helped kids learn to program using [MIT's Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), which is a fantastic platform, and I know others who have worked with Python, which is hard to argue with as a standard.


Plain is not meant to replace either. It is built on the idea that a simple but complete programming language with a grammar similar to English would help younger programmers learn the concepts behind programming by removing the barrier of what seem like obscure symbols. To be clear, I am not an expert in teaching programming. This is only a theory concocted while writing my first compiler.
